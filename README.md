## FizzBuzz - Unit 6
### Assignments from FizzBuzz Unit 6

**File `unit6_assignments.py` contains solutions to the following problems:**
  *Assignment 6.4* - `my_range()` function that returns the same output as `list(range(m, n))` without using `list()`
  *Assignment 6.5* - Color Hex Codes
   - `to_hex` function, which converts decimals in the range from 0 to 255 to Hex *removing leading zeroes* ('0b' becomes 'b')
   - `doubleDigit_hex` function, which converts decimals in the range 0 - 255 to Hex *with the leading zero if necessary* ('0b' is still '0b')
   - `hex_color` function converts an RGB color code from decimal to Hex and adds '#' to the beginning
  *Assignment 6.6* - Reverse an array (without using built-in `reverse()` function)
  *Assignment 6.7* - Find the first number of the Fibonacci sequence that has `n` digits (for 1 it is 1, for 2 it is 13, etc)
  *Assignment 6.8* - Classic programming challenge: FizzBuzz
  *Assignment 6.9* - Check if a number is prime
  *Assignment 6.10* - Look for a lot of prime numbers

**File `palindrome_primes.py` contains solution to the Assignment 6.11**

**File `triangle.py` contains solution to the Assignment 6.13**
